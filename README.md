# My Math Library

### General Information

This branch contains my C++ custom made mathematical classes and methods. <br>
Include the headers and compile the source files along with your project to use them.

## Features

- General includer `Maths.h` can be used to include all maths headers at once
- Constants in `MathConstants.h`
- Basic arithmetic methods in `Arithmetic.h`
- 2D, 3D and 4D vectors respectively in `Vector2.h`, `Vector3.h` and `Vector4.h`
- RGBA, RGB, HSVA and HSV classes in `Color.h`
- Angle-axis rotations in `AngleAxis.h`
- Quaternions in `Quaternion.h`
- Matrices in `Matrix.h`
- Transforms (position, rotation and scale) in `Transform.h`
- Vertices (position, uv, normal) in `Vertex.h`
